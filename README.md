# 🌳 AVL Tree Visualizer

An interactive AVL Tree visualizer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates how a self-balancing Binary Search Tree maintains height balance using rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) with real-time visualization.

## 📌 Overview

The AVL Tree Visualizer allows users to perform dynamic tree operations and observe how the tree automatically rebalances itself after insertions and deletions.

It provides a clear visual understanding of:

- Balance Factor calculation
- Tree rotations
- Height updates
- Self-balancing mechanism

This project is useful for students learning Data Structures and Algorithms, especially AVL Trees.

- Operation History tracking
- Save tree to Local Storage
- Restore saved tree
- Export tree visualization as PNG
- Fully responsive UI design
